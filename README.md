# Project-Degen-Token-ERC-20
The project consists of creating a Degen Token deployed in AVAX Fuji Chain

## Description

The project's purpose is to demonstrate the execution of Degen Token on Avalanche Network, properly showing how the program works, and to test the student's skill. In order to demonstrate the student's project, I was tasked to create and deploy a smart contract on Avalanche network by creating a Game Token with the functionalities of minting, transfering, burning, checking of balance, as well as redeeming token. In addition, the creation of game items, listing of game items, and redeeming were also implemented in the smart contract.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the program

To run this program, open a remix-etherieum IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
Before starting, make sure to set the compiler to version 0.8.18.

### Running the program
1. Create a file with your preferred name. (ex. DegenTokenAvax.sol)
2. Paste the source code from the file (DegenTokenAvax.sol)
3. Press Ctrl + S to compile and save, then change the environment to Injected Provider - Metamask
4. After changing the configuration, the user will be able to launch the smart contract on the AVAX network
5. The next step would be clicking the deploy button, which will pop-up a metamask notification for consuming AVAX token
6. Check the transaction in https://testnet.snowtrace.io/ (Using the wallet address, paste it in the search bar for transactions). 
7. After confirming this, the user may now execute the smart contract.
